## Key Concepts Quick Reference

### Core Architecture
- **Normalized Database**: Single source of truth as graph
- **EQL Queries**: Declarative data requirements
- **Component Co-location**: Query, ident, initial-state with UI
- **Automatic Normalization**: Tree-to-graph conversion
- **Pure Rendering**: Database â†’ UI transformation

### Essential Patterns
```clojure
;; Component definition
(defsc Person [this {:person/keys [id name]}]
  {:query [:person/id :person/name]
   :ident :person/id
   :initial-state (fn [params] {...})}
  (dom/div name))

;; Mutation
(defmutation update-person [params]
  (action [{:keys [state]}] ...)
  (remote [env] true))

;; Loading data
(df/load! this :people Person)
(df/load! this [:person/id 1] Person)
```

### Database Structure
```clojure
{:root/people [[:person/id 1] [:person/id 2]]
 :person/id {1 {:person/id 1 :person/name "Joe"}
             2 {:person/id 2 :person/name "Sally"}}}
```

### Development Workflow
1. Design UI components with queries
2. Set up initial state composition
3. Create mutations for state changes
4. Configure server resolvers
5. Use Fulcro Inspect for debugging

## Best Practices

- **Use template forms** for query/ident/initial-state when possible
- **Namespace keywords** consistently (`:person/name`, `:ui/loading`)
- **Co-locate component concerns** (query with UI, mutations with domain)
- **Leverage normalization** for data consistency
- **Think in terms of graph operations** rather than tree manipulation
- **Use Fulcro Inspect** extensively during development

## Common Gotchas

- **Computed props** must use `comp/computed` to survive render optimization
- **Initial state changes** require browser reload, not hot code reload
- **Ident functions** need access to props, so use lambda form when needed
- **Query composition** must use `comp/get-query` for proper metadata
- **Mutation namespacing** must match between client and server
